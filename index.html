      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m a curious and collaborative data enthusiast who finds energy in solving meaningful problems — especially when it happens in a team full of ideas.</p>
      <p>I believe technology should be accessible and helpful for everyone, which is why I’m actively involved in a student research group developing a decision-support app for seniors with dementia.</p>
      <p>I care about creating a positive atmosphere where people can exchange perspectives, inspire each other, and work toward shared goals. When I join a project, I bring both focus and engagement — because I genuinely care about where we're going and how we get there.</p>
